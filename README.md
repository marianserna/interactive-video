# Hello Visitor!

"Jungle" is single page microsite. Our class was tasked with creating a simple application that uses either the canvas, video or audio element, responds to an event (such as mouse click, key press, or media event), and modifies the HTML or CSS using JavaScript.
For this project, I decided to combine all the options provided and create a microsite with some environmental information, using some footage I had from a visit to the Amazon. This was also my very first time using the Google Maps API.

Take a look at the final result here: http://show.marianserna.com/jungle/

God bless your soul.

xoxo!
